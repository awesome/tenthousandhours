If you believe the 10,000 hours rule (รก la [Outliers](http://gladwell.com/outliers/the-10000-hour-rule/)) then it takes about 10,000 hours of dedicated, focused practice to attain mastery of a skill or subject. So let's. fucking. do this.

This timer will keep track of your time. Start it when you start practice/work/training. Stop it when you stop.
